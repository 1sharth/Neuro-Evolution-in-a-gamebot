# Neuro-Evolution-in-a-gamebot
A virtual bot is trained in 2D environment to dodge bullets thrown at it from any position. This is achieved by Unsupervised Learning through Genetic Algorithms applied on Neural Networks. This has been made in C from scratch. Opengl is used for graphics

to train the network, compile and execute "train.c"
to test the trained network, compile and execute "test.c"

run test.exe to test the trained network.
