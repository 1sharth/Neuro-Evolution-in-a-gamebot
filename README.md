# Neuro-Evolution-in-a-gamebot
A virtual bot is trained in 2D environment to dodge bullets thrown at it from any position. This is achieved by Unsupervised Learning through Genetic Algorithms applied on Neural Networks. This has been made in C from scratch. Opengl is used for graphics

compile and execute train.c to train the network.
compile and execute test.c to test the trained network.

run test.exe to test the trained network.
